### About
- The scope of this project was to implement menus and while/when statements in kotlin.
- It was produced to try my abilities with no intention to be released.
- In future I have the intention to add more functionalities.

### How to open this project?
I recommend you to use the <b>IntelliJ Idea IDE</b>, but you can open it in <b>VS Code</b> as well.
1. Once you have one of these IDEs installed, you may go to the green <b>"<>code"</b> button on page top and download the zip file.
2. Unzip the file and then open the IDE. On IntelliJ, go to <b>"file" -> "open..."</b> (select here the unzipped directory).
3. When the project is open, go to the <b>"main.kt"</b> file, click on the <b>hammer icon</b> on top, then "run" the app in the <b>run icon</b>.
4. You must interact with this program in <b>terminal</b>.
